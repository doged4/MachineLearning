countries	are	calling	wanting	to	know	why	Senator	Schumer	is	not	approving	their	otherwise	approved	Ambassadors!?	Likewise	in	Government	lawyers	and	others	are	being	delayed	at	a	record	pace!	360	great	and	hardworking	people	are	waiting	for	approval	from....															
more	than	a	year	longer	than	any	other	Administration	in	history.	These	are	people	who	have	been	approved	by	committees	and	all	others	yet	Schumer	continues	to	hold	them	back	from	serving	their	Country!	Very	Unfair!																		
how	Democrats	can	all	use	their	ridiculous	sound	bite	and	say	that	a	Wall	doesn‚Äôt	work.	It	does	and	properly	built	almost	100%!	They	say	it‚Äôs	old	technology	-	but	so	is	the	wheel.	They	now	say	it	is	immoral-	but	it	is	far	more	immoral	for	people	to	be	dying!			
the	Oval	Office.	Democrats	come	back	from	vacation	now	and	give	us	the	votes	necessary	for	Border	Security	including	the	Wall.	You	voted	yes	in	2006	and	2013	One	more	yes	but	with	me	in	office	I‚Äôll	get	it	built	and	Fast!												
the	Oval	Office.	Democrats	come	back	from	vacation	now	and	give	us	the	votes	necessary	for	Border	Security	including	the	Wall.	You	voted	yes	in	2006	and	3013	One	more	yes	but	with	me	in	office	I‚Äôll	get	it	built	and	Fast!												
the	only	person	in	America	who	could	say	that	‚ÄúI‚Äôm	bringing	our	great	troops	back	home	with	victory‚Äù	and	get	BAD	press.	It	is	Fake	News	and	Pundits	who	have	FAILED	for	years	that	are	doing	the	complaining.	If	I	stayed	in	Endless	Wars	forever	they	would	still	be	unhappy!				
on	Border	Security	which	you	cannot	have	without	a	strong	and	powerful	Wall.	Our	Southern	Border	has	long	been	an	‚ÄúOpen	Wound‚Äù	where	drugs	criminals	(including	human	traffickers)	and	illegals	would	pour	into	our	Country.	Dems	should	get	back	here	an	fix	now!											
results	are	FAR	BETTER	than	I	ever	said	they	were	going	to	be!	I	campaigned	against	the	NEVER	ENDING	WARS	remember!																																	
on	getting	out	of	Syria	and	other	places.	Now	when	I	start	getting	out	the	Fake	News	Media	or	some	failed	Generals	who	were	unable	to	do	the	job	before	I	arrived	like	to	complain	about	me	&amp;	my	tactics	which	are	working.	Just	doing	what	I	said	I	was	going	to	do!	
but	Donald	Trump	did	what	I	did	in	Syria	which	was	an	ISIS	loaded	mess	when	I	became	President	they	would	be	a	national	hero.	ISIS	is	mostly	gone	we‚Äôre	slowly	sending	our	troops	back	home	to	be	with	their	families	while	at	the	same	time	fighting	ISIS	remnants......					
concrete	Wall	was	NEVER	ABANDONED	as	has	been	reported	by	the	media.	Some	areas	will	be	all	concrete	but	the	experts	at	Border	Patrol	prefer	a	Wall	that	is	see	through	(thereby	making	it	possible	to	see	what	is	happening	on	both	sides).	Makes	sense	to	me!							
Mrs.	Obama	built/has	a	ten	foot	Wall	around	their	D.C.	mansion/compound.	I	agree	totally	necessary	for	their	safety	and	security.	The	U.S.	needs	the	same	thing	slightly	larger	version!																									
by	my	Administration	over	the	holidays	to	save	Coast	Guard	pay	during	this	#SchumerShutdown.	No	thanks	to	the	Democrats	who	left	town	and	are	not	concerned	about	the	safety	and	security	of	Americans!																					
President	Trump‚Äôs	handling	of	Border	Security	-	62%	Approval	Rating.	On	being	a	strong	leader	-	59%.		AP	Poll.	Thank	you!																																
out	to	be	TRUE	now	that	the	Department	of	Justice	and	the	FBI	under	President	Obama	rigged	the	investigation	for	Hillary	and	really	turned	the	screws	on	Trump	and	now	it	looks	like	in	a	corrupt	&amp;	illegal	way.	The	facts	are	out	now.	Whole	Hoax	exposed.	@JesseBWatters						
(on	Russian	Collusion).	Kimberley	Strassel	The	Wall	Street	Journal.	The	Russian	Collusion	fabrication	is	the	greatest	Hoax	in	the	history	of	American	politics.	The	only	Russian	Collusion	was	with	Hillary	and	the	Democrats!																					
being	called	‚ÄúTHE	YEAR	OF	THE	WORKER‚Äù	by	Steve	Moore	co-author	of	‚ÄúTrumponomics.‚Äù	It	was	indeed	a	great	year	for	the	American	Worker	with	the	‚Äúbest	job	market	in	50	years	and	the	lowest	unemployment	rate	ever	for	blacks	and	Hispanics	and	all	workers.	Big	wage	gains.‚Äù							
that	naively	ask	why	didn‚Äôt	the	Republicans	get	approval	to	build	the	Wall	over	the	last	year	it	is	because	IN	THE	SENATE	WE	NEED	10	DEMOCRAT	VOTES	and	they	will	gives	us	‚ÄúNONE‚Äù	for	Border	Security!	Now	we	have	to	do	it	the	hard	way	with	a	Shutdown.	Too	bad!	@FoxNews		
question	were	very	sick	before	they	were	given	over	to	Border	Patrol.	The	father	of	the	young	girl	said	it	was	not	their	fault	he	hadn‚Äôt	given	her	water	in	days.	Border	Patrol	needs	the	Wall	and	it	will	all	end.	They	are	working	so	hard	&amp;	getting	so	little	credit!			
of	children	or	others	at	the	Border	are	strictly	the	fault	of	the	Democrats	and	their	pathetic	immigration	policies	that	allow	people	to	make	the	long	trek	thinking	they	can	enter	our	country	illegally.	They	can‚Äôt.	If	we	had	a	Wall	they	wouldn‚Äôt	even	try!	The	two.....							
a	long	and	very	good	call	with	President	Xi	of	China.	Deal	is	moving	along	very	well.	If	made	it	will	be	very	comprehensive	covering	all	subjects	areas	and	points	of	dispute.	Big	progress	being	made!																		
in	the	White	House	waiting	for	the	Democrats	to	come	on	over	and	make	a	deal	on	Border	Security.	From	what	I	hear	they	are	spending	so	much	time	on	Presidential	Harassment	that	they	have	little	time	left	for	things	like	stopping	crime	and	our	military!								
Angry	Democrats	recently	deleted	approximately	19000	Text	messages	between	FBI	Agent	Lisa	Page	and	her	lover	Agent	Peter	S.	These	Texts	were	asked	for	and	INVALUABLE	to	the	truth	of	the	Witch	Hunt	Hoax.	This	is	a	total	Obstruction	of	Justice.	All	Texts	Demanded!										
to	Sean	Parnell	for	the	nice	comments	on	@foxandfriends	about	the	troops	wonderful	reaction	to	Melania	and	I	in	Iraq	and	Germany.	Great	things	are	happening!																												
and	El	Salvador	are	doing	nothing	for	the	United	States	but	taking	our	money.	Word	is	that	a	new	Caravan	is	forming	in	Honduras	and	they	are	doing	nothing	about	it.	We	will	be	cutting	off	all	aid	to	these	3	countries	-	taking	advantage	of	U.S.	for	years!					
Southern	Border.	Bring	our	car	industry	back	into	the	United	States	where	it	belongs.	Go	back	to	pre-NAFTA	before	so	many	of	our	companies	and	jobs	were	so	foolishly	sent	to	Mexico.	Either	we	build	(finish)	the	Wall	or	we	close	the	Border......											
States	looses	soooo	much	money	on	Trade	with	Mexico	under	NAFTA	over	75	Billion	Dollars	a	year	(not	including	Drug	Money	which	would	be	many	times	that	amount)	that	I	would	consider	closing	the	Southern	Border	a	‚Äúprofit	making	operation.‚Äù	We	build	a	Wall	or.....									
be	forced	to	close	the	Southern	Border	entirely	if	the	Obstructionist	Democrats	do	not	give	us	the	money	to	finish	the	Wall	&amp;	also	change	the	ridiculous	immigration	laws	that	our	Country	is	saddled	with.	Hard	to	believe	there	was	a	Congress	&amp;	President	who	would	approve!							
others	within	the	Fake	News	Universe	were	going	wild	about	my	signing	MAGA	hats	for	our	military	in	Iraq	and	Germany.	If	these	brave	young	people	ask	me	to	sign	their	hat	I	will	sign.	Can	you	imagine	my	saying	NO?	We	brought	or	gave	NO	hats	as	the	Fake	News	first	reported!	
about	the	Wall	everybody	knows	that	a	Wall	will	work	perfectly	(In	Israel	the	Wall	works	99.9%).	This	is	only	about	the	Dems	not	letting	Donald	Trump	&amp;	the	Republicans	have	a	win.	They	may	have	the	10	Senate	votes	but	we	have	the	issue	Border	Security.	2020!						
‚ÄúThe	American	people	understand	that	we	have	been	played	by	foreign	actors	who	would	rather	have	us	fight	their	battles	for	them.	The	President	says	look	this	is	your	neighborhood	you‚Äôve	got	to	stand	up	to	protect	yourselves.	Don‚Äôt	always	look	to	America.‚Äù

right	now	a	full	scale	manhunt	going	on	in	California	for	an	illegal	immigrant	accused	of	shooting	and	killing	a	police	officer	during	a	traffic	stop.	Time	to	get	tough	on	Border	Security.	Build	the	Wall!																		
Agents	want	the	Wall.‚Äù	Democrat‚Äôs	say	they	don‚Äôt	want	the	Wall	(even	though	they	know	it	is	really	needed)	and	they	don‚Äôt	want	ICE.	They	don‚Äôt	have	much	to	campaign	on	do	they?	An	Open	Southern	Border	and	the	large	scale	crime	that	comes	with	such	stupidity!							
the	DACA	for	Wall	deal	didn‚Äôt	get	done	was	that	a	ridiculous	court	decision	from	the	9th	Circuit	allowed	DACA	to	remain	thereby	setting	up	a	Supreme	Court	case.	After	ruling	Dems	dropped	deal	-	and	that‚Äôs	where	we	are	today	Democrat	obstruction	of	the	needed	Wall.							
OBSTRUCTION	of	the	desperately	needed	Wall	where	they	almost	all	recently	agreed	it	should	be	built	is	exceeded	only	by	their	OBSTRUCTION	of	350	great	people	wanting	&amp;	expecting	to	come	into	Government	after	being	delayed	for	more	than	two	years	a	U.S.	record!

Democrats	finally	realized	that	we	desperately	need	Border	Security	and	a	Wall	on	the	Southern	Border.	Need	to	stop	Drugs	Human	TraffickingGang	Members	&amp;	Criminals	from	coming	into	our	Country.	Do	the	Dems	realize	that	most	of	the	people	not	getting	paid	are	Democrats?										
from	visiting	our	troops	in	Iraq	and	Germany.	One	thing	is	certain	we	have	incredible	people	representing	our	Country	-	people	that	know	how	to	win!																												
and	I	were	honored	to	visit	our	incredible	troops	at	Al	Asad	Air	Base	in	Iraq.	GOD	BLESS	THE	U.S.A.!	https://t.co/rDlhITDvm1																																	
everyone	even	the	Fake	News	Media	is	having	a	great	Christmas!	Our	Country	is	doing	very	well.	We	are	securing	our	Borders	making	great	new	Trade	Deals	and	bringing	our	Troops	Back	Home.	We	are	finally	putting	America	First.	MERRY	CHRISTMAS!		#MAGA											
																																																					
in	the	Oval	Office	&amp;	just	gave	out	a	115	mile	long	contract	for	another	large	section	of	the	Wall	in	Texas.	We	are	already	building	and	renovating	many	miles	of	Wall	some	complete.	Democrats	must	end	Shutdown	and	finish	funding.	Billions	of	Dollars	&amp;	lives	will	be	saved!

all	alone	(poor	me)	in	the	White	House	waiting	for	the	Democrats	to	come	back	and	make	a	deal	on	desperately	needed	Border	Security.	At	some	point	the	Democrats	not	wanting	to	make	a	deal	will	cost	our	Country	more	money	than	the	Border	Wall	we	are	all	talking	about.	Crazy!			
has	now	agreed	to	spend	the	necessary	money	needed	to	help	rebuild	Syria	instead	of	the	United	States.	See?	Isn‚Äôt	it	nice	when	immensely	wealthy	countries	help	rebuild	their	neighbors	rather	than	a	Great	Country	the	U.S.	that	is	5000	miles	away.	Thanks	to	Saudi	A!								
is	different	than	the	25	Billion	Dollars	in	Border	Security.	The	complete	Wall	will	be	built	with	the	Shutdown	money	plus	funds	already	in	hand.	The	reporting	has	been	inaccurate	on	the	point.	The	problem	is	without	the	Wall	much	of	the	rest	of	Dollars	are	wasted!							
‚Äúlashed	out‚Äù	at	the	Acting	Attorney	General	of	the	U.S.	a	man	for	whom	I	have	great	respect.	This	is	a	made	up	story	one	of	many	by	the	Fake	News	Media!																						
problem	our	economy	has	is	the	Fed.	They	don‚Äôt	have	a	feel	for	the	Market	they	don‚Äôt	understand	necessary	Trade	Wars	or	Strong	Dollars	or	even	Democrat	Shutdowns	over	Borders.	The	Fed	is	like	a	powerful	golfer	who	can‚Äôt	score	because	he	has	no	touch	-	he	can‚Äôt	putt!

of	the	sympathizers	out	there	of	Brett	McGurk	remember	he	was	the	Obama	appointee	who	was	responsible	for	loading	up	airplanes	with	1.8	Billion	Dollars	in	CASH	&amp;		sending	it	to	Iran	as	part	of	the	horrific	Iran	Nuclear	Deal	(now	terminated)	approved	by	Little	Bob	Corker.						
substantially	subsidizing	the	Militaries	of	many	VERY	rich	countries	all	over	the	world	while	at	the	same	time	these	countries	take	total	advantage	of	the	U.S.	and	our	TAXPAYERS	on	Trade.	General	Mattis	did	not	see	this	as	a	problem.	I	DO	and	it	is	being	fixed!							
few	Senators	who	think	I	don‚Äôt	like	or	appreciate	being	allied	with	other	countries	they	are	wrong	I	DO.	What	I	don‚Äôt	like	however	is	when	many	of	these	same	countries	take	advantage	of	their	friendship	with	the	United	States	both	in	Military	Protection	and	Trade...								
Democrat	we	are	dealing	with	today	strongly	supported	a	Border	Wall	or	Fence.	It	was	only	when	I	made	it	an	important	part	of	my	campaign	because	people	and	drugs	were	pouring	into	our	Country	unchecked	that	they	turned	against	it.	Desperately	needed!											
of	Turkey	has	very	strongly	informed	me	that	he	will	eradicate	whatever	is	left	of	ISIS	in	Syria....and	he	is	a	man	who	can	do	it	plus	Turkey	is	right	‚Äúnext	door.‚Äù	Our	troops	are	coming	home!

important	way	to	stop	gangs	drugs	human	trafficking	and	massive	crime	is	at	our	Southern	Border.	We	need	Border	Security	and	as	EVERYONE	knows	you	can‚Äôt	have	Border	Security	without	a	Wall.	The	Drones	&amp;	Technology	are	just	bells	and	whistles.	Safety	for	America!										
just	told	a	group	of	people	and	me	that	he	has	been	in	the	U.S.	Senate	for	32	years	and	the	last	two	have	been	by	far	the	best	&amp;	most	productive	of	his	career.	Tax	&amp;	Regulation	Cuts	VA	Choice	Farm	Bill	Criminal	Justice	Reform	Judgeships	&amp;	much	more.	Great!			
not	be	the	job	of	America	to	replace	regimes	around	the	world.	This	is	what	President	Trump	recognized	in	Iraq	that	it	was	the	biggest	foreign	policy	disaster	of	the	last	several	decades	and	he‚Äôs	right...The	generals	still	don‚Äôt	get	the	mistake.‚Äù		@RandPaul										
	‚ÄúI	am	very	proud	of	the	President.	This	is	exactly	what	he	promised	and	I	think	the	people	agree	with	him.	We‚Äôve	been	at	war	too	long	and	in	too	many	places...spent	several	trillion	dollars	on	these	wars	everywhere.	He‚Äôs	different...that‚Äôs	why	he	got	elected.‚Äù								
was	responsible	for	giving	us	the	horrible	Iran	Nuclear	Deal	which	I	ended	yet	he	badmouths	me	for	wanting	to	bring	our	young	people	safely	back	home.	Bob	wanted	to	run	and	asked	for	my	endorsement.	I	said	NO	and	the	game	was	over.	#MAGA	I	LOVE	TENNESSEE!						
Corker	just	stated	that	‚ÄúI‚Äôm	so	priveledged	to	serve	in	the	Senate	for	twelve	years	and	that‚Äôs	what	I	told	the	people	of	our	state	that‚Äôs	what	I‚Äôd	do	serve	for	two	terms.‚Äù	But	that	is	Not	TRUE	-	wanted	to	run	but	poll	numbers	TANKED	when	I	wouldn‚Äôt	endorse	him.....			
two	pieces	of	major	legislation	this	week	Criminal	Justice	Reform	and	the	Farm	Bill.	These	are	two	Big	Deals	but	all	the	Fake	News	Media	wants	to	talk	about	is	‚Äúthe	mistake‚Äù	of	bringing	our	young	people	back	home	from	the	Never	Ending	Wars.	It	all	began	19	years	ago!				
from	the	tsunami	disaster	in	Indonesia.	More	than	two	hundred	dead	and	nearly	a	thousand	injured	or	unaccounted	for.	We	are	praying	for	recovery	and	healing.	America	is	with	you!																								
had	a	long	and	productive	call	with	President	@RT_Erdogan	of	Turkey.	We	discussed	ISIS	our	mutual	involvement	in	Syria	&amp;	the	slow	&amp;	highly	coordinated	pullout	of	U.S.	troops	from	the	area.	After	many	years	they	are	coming	home.	We	also	discussed	heavily	expanded	Trade.									
pleased	to	announce	that	our	very	talented	Deputy	Secretary	of	Defense	Patrick	Shanahan	will	assume	the	title	of	Acting	Secretary	of	Defense	starting	January	1	2019	Patrick	has	a	long	list	of	accomplishments	while	serving	as	Deputy	&amp;	previously	Boeing.	He	will	be	great!										
way	to	stop	drugs	gangs	human	trafficking	criminal	elements	and	much	else	from	coming	into	our	Country	is	with	a	Wall	or	Barrier.	Drones	and	all	of	the	rest	are	wonderful	and	lots	of	fun	but	it	is	only	a	good	old	fashioned	Wall	that	works!								
Obama	ingloriously	fired	Jim	Mattis	I	gave	him	a	second	chance.	Some	thought	I	shouldn‚Äôt	I	thought	I	should.	Interesting	relationship-but	I	also	gave	all	of	the	resources	that	he	never	really	had.	Allies	are	very	important-but	not	when	they	take	advantage	of	U.S.										
but	your	favorite	President	Donald	J.	Trump	announced	that	after	decimating	ISIS	in	Syria	we	were	going	to	bring	our	troops	back	home	(happy	&amp;	healthy)	that	person	would	be	the	most	popular	hero	in	America.	With	me	hit	hard	instead	by	the	Fake	News	Media.	Crazy!

Ronald	Reagan	tried	for	8	years	to	build	a	Border	Wall	or	Fence	and	was	unable	to	do	so.	Others	also	have	tried.	We	will	get	it	done	one	way	or	the	other!																					
if	Democrats	do	not	vote	for	Border	Security!																																														
Vote	217-185.																																																				
whose	votes	we	need	in	the	Senate	will	probably	vote	against	Border	Security	and	the	Wall	even	though	they	know	it	is	DESPERATELY	NEEDED.	If	the	Dems	vote	no	there	will	be	a	shutdown	that	will	last	for	a	very	long	time.	People	don‚Äôt	want	Open	Borders	and	Crime!					
what	happens	today	in	the	Senate	Republican	House	Members	should	be	very	proud	of	themselves.	They	flew	back	to	Washington	from	all	parts	of	the	World	in	order	to	vote	for	Border	Security	and	the	Wall.	Not	one	Democrat	voted	yes	and	we	won	big.	I	am	very	proud	of	you!			
Border	is	only	effective	in	conjunction	with	a	Wall.	Properly	designed	and	built	Walls	work	and	the	Democrats	are	lying	when	they	say	they	don‚Äôt.	In	Israel	the	Wall	is	99.90%	successful.	Will	not	be	any	different	on	our	Southern	Border!	Hundreds	of	$Billions	saved!									
are	trying	to	belittle	the	concept	of	a	Wall	calling	it	old	fashioned.	The	fact	is	there	is	nothing	else‚Äôs	that	will	work	and	that	has	been	TRUE	for	thousands	of	years.	It‚Äôs	like	the	wheel	there	is	nothing	better.	I	know	tech	better	than	anyone	&amp;	technology.....						
McConnell	should	fight	for	the	Wall	and	Border	Security	as	hard	as	he	fought	for	anything.	He	will	need	Democrat	votes	but	as	shown	in	the	House	good	things	happen.	If	enough	Dems	don‚Äôt	vote	it	will	be	a	Democrat	Shutdown!	House	Republicans	were	great	yesterday!								
be	Speaker	Nancy	Pelosi	said	last	week	live	from	the	Oval	Office	that	the	Republicans	didn‚Äôt	have	the	votes	for	Border	Security.	Today	the	House	Republicans	voted	and	won	217-185.	Nancy	does	not	have	to	apologize.	All	I	want	is	GREAT	BORDER	SECURITY!											
to	our	GREAT	Republican	Members	of	Congress	for	your	VOTE	to	fund	Border	Security	and	the	Wall.	The	final	numbers	were	217-185	and	many	have	said	that	the	enthusiasm	was	greater	than	they	have	ever	seen	before.	So	proud	of	you	all.	Now	on	to	the	Senate!							
Mattis	will	be	retiring	with	distinction	at	the	end	of	February	after	having	served	my	Administration	as	Secretary	of	Defense	for	the	past	two	years.	During	Jim‚Äôs	tenure	tremendous	progress	has	been	made	especially	with	respect	to	the	purchase	of	new	fighting....												
Mattis	was	a	great	help	to	me	in	getting	allies	and	other	countries	to	pay	their	share	of	military	obligations.	A	new	Secretary	of	Defense	will	be	named	shortly.	I	greatly	thank	Jim	for	his	service!

begrudgingly	signed	the	Omnibus	Bill	I	was	promised	the	Wall	and	Border	Security	by	leadership.	Would	be	done	by	end	of	year	(NOW).	It	didn‚Äôt	happen!	We	foolishly	fight	for	Border	Security	for	other	countries	-	but	not	for	our	beloved	U.S.A.	Not	good!										
much	talk	about	the	Wall	people	are	losing	sight	of	the	great	job	being	done	on	our	Southern	Border	by	Border	Patrol	ICE	and	our	great	Military.	Remember	the	Caravans?	Well	they	didn‚Äôt	get	through	and	none	are	forming	or	on	their	way.	Border	is	tight.	Fake	News	silent!					
who	know	Steel	Slats	(Wall)	are	necessary	for	Border	Security	are	putting	politics	over	Country.	What	they	are	just	beginning	to	realize	is	that	I	will	not	sign	any	of	their	legislation	including	infrastructure	unless	it	has	perfect	Border	Security.	U.S.A.	WINS!												
Syria	&amp;	many	others	are	not	happy	about	the	U.S.	leaving	despite	what	the	Fake	News	says	because	now	they	will	have	to	fight	ISIS	and	others	who	they	hate	without	us.	I	am	building	by	far	the	most	powerful	military	in	the	world.	ISIS	hits	us	they	are	doomed!				
USA	want	to	be	the	Policeman	of	the	Middle	East	getting	NOTHING	but	spending	precious	lives	and	trillions	of	dollars	protecting	others	who	in	almost	all	cases	do	not	appreciate	what	we	are	doing?	Do	we	want	to	be	there	forever?	Time	for	others	to	finally	fight.....

Adam	Schiff	is	starting	to	blame	President	Obama	for	Russian	meddling	in	the	election	he	is	probably	doing	so	as	yet	another	excuse	that	the	Democrats	lead	by	their	fearless	leader	Crooked	Hillary	Clinton	lost	the	2016	election.	But	wasn‚Äôt	I	a	great	candidate?

forgot	to	say	that	the	results	of	the	2016	election	were	not	impacted	or	changed	by	the	Russians	and	that	the	only	Collusion	was	between	Russia	and	Crooked	H	the	DNC	and	the	Dems.	Remember	the	Dirty	Dossier	Uranium	Speeches	Emails	and	the	Podesta	Company!

what	I	have	always	known	that	@Reince	Priebus	is	the	tough	one	and	the	smart	one	not	Debbie	Wasserman	Shultz	(@DWStweets.)

.@chucktodd,said,today,on,@meetthepress,that,attacking"	Bill	to	get	to	Hillary	has	never	worked	before."	Wrong	-	attacked	him	in	'08	&amp;	won!																													
remember	when	Bill	Clinton	in	2008	worked	long	and	hard	for	Hillary?	She	LOST!	Now	Bill	is	at	it	again.	Just	watch.

that	guns	don't	keep	you	safe.	If	she	really	believes	that	she	should	demand	that	her	heavily	armed	bodyguards	quickly	disarm!																																	
ISIS	just	made	a	video	on	me	-	they	all	will	as	front-runner	&amp;	if	I	speak	out	against	them	which	I	must.	Hillary	lied!																													
lied	last	week	when	she	said	ISIS	made	a	D.T.	video.	The	video	that	ISIS	made	was	about	her	husband	being	a	degenerate.

look	at	all	of	the	money	the	special	interests	and	lobbyists	are	giving	to	candidates	beware	-	the	candidates	are	mere	puppets	$$$$!
